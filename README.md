## Converto - Image to PDF converter

This is a simple application made using NextJS, jsPDF, TailwindCSS and Typescript. It converts the images uploaded by the users to pdf format. It uses a drag & drop as well as upload button for the uploading of images. 

### Further scope
 Features like 
    - Multiple formatted documents converter. 
    - Edit PDFs online.
    - Collaborative nature of the PDF editor.
    - Merging or deleting different PDF pages. 

We can connect this to S3 for data storage for a well engineered approach. 

Feel free to connect for discussions about such innovative project. I am open to work full time as a developer. Hit up with any types of suggestions or referrals. Thank you. patadiaharsh.8@gmail.com
